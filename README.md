# Car-Rental-System

A new up and coming car rental service is wishing to have a user interface that will allow their customers to view the models, descriptions and prices of different cars available. The user has the ability to register and log in to the system and track their rental plan. The program code will be responsive, allowing for the customer to view it. The administrator will also be able to login through the same form but have the ability to add/remove new car rentals, change prices, and so on.

Car Rental System is based on a concept to rent cars and generate rental invoice of a rental company. Before stepping into the main system a user has to pass through a login system to get access, then only the user can select cars with a different model and rent for certain days.

Talking about the features of the Car Rental System, after logging in as a user he/she has to provide a name then the user can select available cars. After selecting a car, the system displays selected car details which contain maximum power, mileage and many more. Then the user has to provide the information such as Car number and number of days to rent the car. After all these procedures, the system calculates rent and displays Customer Invoice presenting invoice number, customerâ€™s name, car model, number, number of days and total rental amount.
